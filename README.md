# Cognitive-Samples
A collection of samples for working with Microsoft Cognitive Services in various languages and platforms. All samples were written by Martin kearn and intended to plug gaps in the official documentation. Refer to https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/ for full documentation and official samples.

Samples are generally organised as follows API > Function > Language.

Samples are deliberatley kept as simple and clear as possible.

The Recommendations 'sportswear' sample has been moved to its own repo: https://github.com/martinkearn/Recommendations
